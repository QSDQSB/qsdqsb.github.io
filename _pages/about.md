## What's New!
_"有哪些文件夹刚刚被新建了呢？"_

## What else should we do before publishing this page?

Test `latex`: 
$$\small\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, \exists \,\varepsilon >0 \,\,s.t. $$
{: .text-center}

_That was too easy, let's try:_
{: .barlow}

##### Argument Principle
{: .barlow}

> Suppose that $U$ is an open set and $f: U \rightarrow$ $\mathbb{C}$ is a *meromorphic* function on $U$. If $B(a, r) \subseteq U$ and $N$ is the number of zeros (counted with multiplicity) and $P$ is the number of poles (again counted with multiplicity) of $f$ *inside* $B(a, r)$ and $f$ has neither on $\partial B(a, r)$ then $$N-P=\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{\gamma} \frac{f^{\prime}(z)}{f(z)} d z,$$ where $\gamma(t)=a+r e^{2 \pi i t}$ is a path with image $\partial B(a, r)$. Moreover this is the *winding number* of the path $\Gamma=f \circ \gamma$ about the origin.
{: .barlow}

Don't know what this is? It's quite simple, just get a maths degree and you will see.

#### Something Utterly Ludicrous
{: .barlow}

Consider a language that doesn't support the logic `not`, 13 years after someone pointing out: *[The Mighty Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/issues/138)*
