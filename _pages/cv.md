Experiences
======
{% capture experiences_content %}
1. I have a degree (37.5 degree celsius).
2. I have a job and it's quite interesting (hopefully no need to change this line).
3. I am good at googling:
  - this site was forked from [academic page template](https://academicpages.github.io) then heavily modified in Feb 2022.
  - I have zero knowledge of HTML / CSS / JS when this project started.
  - Roughly 55% of the commits were without LLM assistance. Roughly 95% of the commits were without Cursor-like Ai assistance (as of Oct 2025).
  - Thanks for the magnificent tutorials and guides from *CodePen*, *StackOverflow*, and *CSS-Tricks*.
