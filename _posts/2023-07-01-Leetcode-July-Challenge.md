# `01` [Maximum Number of Achievable Transfer Requests](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-achievable-transfer-requests/description)
`Hard` `DFS`

> You are given an integer array `cookies`, where `cookies[i]` denotes the number of cookies in the `ith` bag. You are also given an integer `k` that denotes the number of children to distribute **all** the bags of cookies to. All the cookies in the same bag must go to the same child and cannot be split up.
> 
> The **unfairness** of a distribution is defined as the maximum total cookies obtained by a single child in the distribution.
> Return _the **minimum** unfairness of all distributions_.

## Basic Idea: DFS
A counterexample where Greedy fails can be easily constructed. We observe the constraint that `2 <= cookies.length <= 8`, hence the clue of using DFS.

The idea is to iterate the `cookies`. Each time we distribute this `cookies` to any possible children, and go to the next layer of DFS.
```python
class Solution:
    def distributeCookies(self, cookies: List[int], k: int) -> int:
		ans = sum(cookies)
        
        def searchCandies(i, children, current_max):
            nonlocal ans
            # children records the current candies each child has
            # current_max records the local answer
            if i>=len(cookies):
                ans = min(ans, current_max)
                return
            for child_id in range(len(children)):
                # we assign the cookie to child i
                if children[child_id]+cookies[i] >= ans: continue
                children[child_id] += cookies[i]
                searchCandies(i+1, children,  
                max(current_max, children[child_id]))
                children[child_id] -= cookies[i]
        searchCandies(0, [0]*k, 0)
        return ans
```

### Optimise: Early Stop
```python
if children[child_id]+cookies[i] >= ans: continue
```
The `ans` is an existing local solution. So there is no point to do further DFS if the current distribution plan has a larger unfairness.

### Caution: `nonlocal`
If you delete `nonlocal` in code, an error emerges: `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'ans' referenced before assignment`.
This is because Python does not know the `ans` variable in our `searchCandies` function. It will consider it as a local variable, hence creating a new `ans` inside the function - this explains the description of this error.

There are two ways to get around this. First is this `nonlocal` argument. The second is to move `ans` to the `Solution` class. i.e. define `ans` (and use it) in the form of `self.ans`.

## Further Optimisation
An idea is to have a better starting point. We use `heap` to formulate a *greedy* solution: Each time we assign a cookie to the child with least number of cookies. This has constant time cost (because the number of cookies smaller than 8), but will give a very nice upper bound of solution, which cuts lots of leaves in the later DFS.

Simply replace the `ans = sum(cookies)` with this:
```python
cookies.sort(reverse = True)
heap = [0] * k
for i in cookies:
	currentLeastChild = heapq.heappop(heap)
	currentLeastChild += i
	heapq.heappush(heap,currentLeastChild)
ans = max(heap)
```
- `sort` is again optional, but basically costs no time.
- This gives the fastest solution on Leetcode.s

# `02` [Fair Distribution of Cookies](https://leetcode.com/problems/fair-distribution-of-cookies/)
`Hard` `DFS` `Divide and Conquer`

- Use `bitMask` to search request cases
- There's a very nice article about how to optimise by divide and conquer *path lengths*.

        def bitmaskToBool(n):
            bitsOn = []
            while n:
                bitsOn.append(n%2==1)
                n = n//2
            return(bitsOn)
        ans = 0
        for mask in range(1, (1<<len(requests))):
            bitsOn = bitmaskToBool(mask)
            pathLength = sum(bitsOn)
            if pathLength<=ans: continue

            indeg = [0 for _ in range(n)]
            for i in range(len(bitsOn)):
                if not bitsOn[i]: continue
                req = requests[i]
                indeg[req[0]]-=1
                indeg[req[1]]+=1
            if all([x==0 for x in indeg]):
                ans = max(ans, pathLength)
        return(ans)

            l = current = count = 0
            for i in range(len(answerKey)):
                if answerKey[i]==c: count+=1 # WT replace c
                while count > k: #don't want the left
                    if answerKey[l]==c: count-=1
                    l+=1
                current = max(current, i-l+1)

It's easy to think about taking a sum of neighbours and try to locate extreme situations among them. Two things to consider: `1` the boundary of arrays `2` the one-element groups. The first is easy to figure out, because in max and min cases the 0th and -1th element has to be included in the cost, so it cancel out.

For the second, take a neighbour sum (e.g. `np.array(weights[1:]) + np.array(weights[:-1])`). You will find out that **the partition is actually bijective to taking $k-1$ elements from neighbour-sum.**

Didn't use `numpy`, as importing is slow, and wanna beat as many people as possible for QSD's bizzard dignity.

# `09` [Substring With Largest Variance](https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-largest-variance/)
`Hard` `DP`

Finally an interesting question. Good for Leetcode 😌. 
{: .notice--success}

> The *variance* of a string is defined as the largest difference between the number of occurrences of any 2 characters present in the string. Note the two characters may or may not be the same.
>
> Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters only, return the largest variance possible among all substrings of `s`.
>
> A *substring* is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Constraints** $1 \leq s.length \leq 10^4$

---

Classical DP question (as the data constraint suggests). The first idea is to 
    1. iterate the two letters among all letters.
    2. count the occurrence among all possible substrings of `s`.  

This is clearly TLE. Then `DP` naturally comes up to skip unncessary sub-problems during Step 2. The *difference of occurrence between two letters* is then linked to [Kadane's Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/largest-sum-contiguous-subarray/) (The classical $O(n)$ solution to **Largest Sum Contiguous Subarray** problem).

> One problem remains is the situation of $abb$, which, as we reset the difference to 0 to find the optimal solution in Kadane, results in answer `0`. The convenient solution is to calculate again for `s[::-1]`. *(Further optimisation for this clearly exists as the overlapping of calculation, but only provides constant optimisation for time complexity)*

`time complexity` $26^2*\text{len}(s)$

```python
class Solution:
    def largestVariance(self, s: str) -> int:
        letters = set(s)

        for a in letters:
            for b in letters:
                if a==b: continue
                for sSs in [s,s[::-1]]:
                    curMax = countA = countB = 0
                    for letter in sSs:
                        if letter not in [a,b]: continue
                        countA+= (letter==a)

# `15` [Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended-ii)
`Hard` `DP`

> You are given an array of events where `events[i]` = `[startDayi, endDayi, valuei]`. The ith event starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of `valuei`. You are also given an integer `k` which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.
>
> You can only attend one event at a time. If you choose to attend an event, you must attend the entire event. Note that the end day is inclusive: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends on the same day.
>
> Return the maximum sum of values that you can receive by attending events.

**Constraints** $1\leq k * events.length \leq 10^6$

一眼DP。然后把数据量看成`1≤k≤events.length≤10^6`，然后想了一年啊这怎么可能$O(n)$做啊啊啊啊，然后发现原来就是简单DP。 $dp[i][j]$前i件选j件的max。

```python
class Solution:
    def maxValue(self, events: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        events.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        terminates = [x[1] for x in events]
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, j):
            if i<0 or j==0: return 0
            startat = bisect.bisect_left(terminates, events[i][0])-1
            return max(dp(startat,j-1)+events[i][2], dp(i-1,j))
        return dp(len(events)-1,k)

# `16` [Smallest Sufficient Team](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-sufficient-team)
`Hard` `Bitmask` `DFS`

> In a project, you have a list of required skills `req_skills`, and a list of people. The ith person `people[i]` contains a list of skills that the person has.
>
> Consider a sufficient team: a set of people such that for every required skill in `req_skills`, there is at least one person in the team who has that skill. We can represent these teams by the index of each person.
> 
> Return any sufficient team of the smallest possible size, represented by the index of each person. You may return the answer in any order. It is guaranteed an answer exists.

**Constraints** 
- $1 \leq req_skills.length \leq 16$
- $1 \leq people.length \leq 60$
- All the strings of `people[i]` are unique.
- Every skill in `people[i]` is a skill in `req_skills`.

A nice heavy-coding problem I would say. Most tricky in this month so far :).

## The Set Cover Problem
The question's model is [set cover problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_cover_problem), which is NP complete, hence no exact polynomial-time solutions. Appropriate [greedy algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_cover_problem#Greedy_algorithm) can optimise the time complexity to approximately polynomial.

## The Optimisation
Indeed, we never no if we have achieved the minimal answer until searched all possible combinations. Therefore, the key is to constrain the *possible combinations* set:

1. create `skillsWho`
2. use *bitmask* and bit operations to speed up set union and zero check processes.
3. discard useless people (🐠) that are skills-dominated by others.
4. constrain the initial search to the skill with fewest people having it
5. Sort elements of `skillsWho` according to the descending orders of number of skills they have.

Note that 4️⃣ and 5️⃣ do not cut every corner. They speed up the convergence by finding a smaller `ans` earlier. *(essence of this greedy idea: we tend to desire people covering more skills)*

Simple coding. Key to `O(1)` time complexity is
1. Use `dict` to store keys
2. To *store* the newest data, we *refresh* by popping it up and reading it back. Therefore we only need to delete the first element in the dictionary (which can be done by `iter` and `next`).

```python
class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.elementDict = {}
    def get(self, key: int) -> int:
        if key in self.elementDict:
            val = self.elementDict.pop(key)
            self.elementDict[key] = val
            return val
        return -1        
    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
        if key in self.elementDict:
            self.elementDict.pop(key)
        else:
            if len(self.elementDict) == self.capacity:
                ancient = next(iter(self.elementDict))
                del self.elementDict[ancient]
        self.elementDict[key] = value
```

# `19` [Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)
`Medium` `Greedy`

> Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Greedy. We sort and start from the right, if the current fit in, then we take it, otherwise we drop it.

Fiddling with an example helps to get this idea quickly.

```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)
        current, drop = intervals[0], 0
        for s, e in intervals[1:]:
            if current[0]>=e:
                current = [s,e]
            else:
                drop+=1
        return(drop)
```

`Medium`

> We are given an array `asteroids` of integers representing asteroids in a row.

Simple simulation. We use `cur` to record the current border. On the left of the border is the thing we have dealt with the collision.

Time Complexity should be below $O(n^2)$, because of potentially going to the end and going back.

```python
class Solution:
    def asteroidCollision(self, asteroids: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        cur = 0
        for i in range(len(asteroids)):
            while cur and asteroids[cur-1]>0 and asteroids[i]<0 and abs(asteroids[cur-1])<abs(asteroids[i]):
                cur-=1#crush
            if asteroids[i]>0 or asteroids[cur-1]<0 or cur==0:
                asteroids[cur] = asteroids[i]
                cur+=1
            elif asteroids[cur-1] == abs(asteroids[i]):
                cur-=1

Classic DP. $f[i]$ records the max length of increasing subsequence ending at $i$. Update `count` when finding previous length to be $f[i]-1$.   

```python

    def findNumberOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        f = count = [1]*n

                if nums[i]<=nums[j]: continue
                if f[i] == f[j]+1:
                    count[i]+=count[j]
                elif f[i] < f[j]+1:
                    f[i], count[i] = f[j]+1, count[j]
        ans = max(f)
