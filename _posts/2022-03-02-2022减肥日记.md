🍧QSD于2018年，2020年，2021年，2022年，2023年，2025年共启动7次减肥计划。
📔所幸七次计划均有纸面记录。
😵因此我们得以揭露他如何一步步通过各种偷懒、怠惰，胖成现在这样子的。
⚠️以警醒世人。

## Attempt #7: From 24.07.2025
{: .didot}

<h3 class="didot" style="color: whitesmoke;">Ongoing!减肥进行时💨💨💨!</h3>

<section class="paragraph-center-wrapper translucent_border didot">

<div class="center-wrapper"><h1 style="border: none;color: whitesmoke">Commitment 2025#1</h1></div>

<p>Utterly benumbed by post-univ life while alarmingly spoiled by Singapore’s sumptuous Asian fare, <span class="sans-serif">QSD</span> found himself idling with no achievement, only burgeoning love handles.</p>

<p class="notice--info" style="background-color: #00214724; border: 1px solid #00214705;"><span class="macaron barlow"><i>love handles</i></span>: the layer of <u>fat</u> around the middle of a person’s body.<br>(Cambridge Dictionary)</p>

<p>Prospering in flesh but not in virtue, <span class="sans-serif">QSD</span> concedes the symbiosis of work and Singaporean gastronomy has taken its toll. Thus so, not entirely unprovoked, but <i>ex nihilo</i>, he resolves to start a 12-week weight-loss initiative. The following solemn commitments are henceforth enacted, as of today.</p>

<h6>Commitments</h6>

<ol>
<li><span class="sans-serif">QSD</span> shall abstain from all sugary indulgences. Chocolates (regardless of origin, office or otherwise), milk tea, bottled beverages (unless under 30 kcal per serving) and snacks are strictly prohibited, with the exception being nuts and seaweed.</li>
<li>Fast food is limited to one McDonald’s visit per week, with corn as the only permissible side. Junk food is renounced <i>centum per centum</i>.</li>
<li>Carbohydrates, such as rice and noodles, are ideally condemned. Dishes drenched in oil, particularly from a certain country’s cuisine, shall be eschewed. Leniency to this item may be considered during get-together occasions.</li>
<li><span class="sans-serif">QSD</span> should avoid delivery orders when possible. In exceptions granted in extremis, only bentos and salad boxes shall <i>pass muster</i>.</li>
<li>During office hours, <span class="sans-serif">QSD</span> is encouraged to do pick-ups, to earn not just calories, but steps and dollars!</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>On any date of transgression, <span class="sans-serif">QSD</span> shall visit the office pantry as frequently as possible the following workday, and there exercise maximal sociability - greeting, networking and showcasing without reserve - to anyone he encounters. A public penance, of sorts.</p>

## Attempt #6: From 09.10.2023 To 09.12.2023
{: .didot}
This commitment was effective throughout <span class="barlow">Michelmas Term, 2023</span>, QSD's final year at Queen's.

<section class="paragraph-center-wrapper translucent_border didot">

<div class="text-center"><h1 style="border: none;color: whitesmoke">Commitment 2023#2</h1></div>
<div class="text-center"><p><i><b><span class="sans-serif">QSD</span></b>, the <b>obligor</b>, with <b>Party B</b>, the <b><span class="sans-serif">supervisor</span></b></i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="sans-serif">QSD</span>’s body figure has deteriorated to the point of utter self-
loathing and humiliation. A desperate plan to address his beer belly
is of top priority.</p>

<p>With unprecedented resoluteness, <span class="sans-serif">QSD</span> solemnly commits to:</p>

<ul>
<li>perform HIIT for 15min everyday</li>
<li>participate in gym’s Cycle class at least two times a week</li>
<li>prohibit any intake of sugar-contained liquid, except for oat Americano.</li>
<li>refrain from ordering delivery for himself alone.</li>
<li>opt for sandwiches, M&S salmon and salads as meals whenever possible</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="sans-serif">QSD</span> should report his daily status to <i>Party B</i>. Any violation will result in a £10 penalty.</p>

<p>This commitment stays valid until the end of the Michaelmas term.</p>

## Attempt #5: From 12.05.2022 to 23.05.2022
{: .didot}

The unfortunate brief duration tells everything. QSD's willpower cannot be yielded unless harsh penalties are imposed.

<section class="paragraph-center-wrapper translucent_border didot">

<div class="center-wrapper"><h1 style="border: none;color: whitesmoke">Commitment 2022#2</h1></div>

<p><span class="sans-serif">QSD</span> has observed <u>an increasing amount of chin<b>s</b></u> under the same angle of depression, an epitome of a plunge of his possibility to find a girlfriend. It is therefore urgent to put up a diet plan on agenda.</p>

<p>History has relentlessly proved that <u>plans with obscurity and redundancy are usually arduous to carry out</u>. Accordingly, <span class="sans-serif">QSD</span> will do his best to shorten the number of his commitments:</p>

<h6>Commitments</h6>

<ul>
<li>A restriction on coffee to Americano, with an exemption of a cup of latte every day</li>
<li>A strict prohibition on any intake of fruit tea and milk tea</li>
<li>A strict prohibition on any personal purchase of chocolate, candies, biscuits and cakes</li>
<li>A strict prohibition on any non-liquid intake between 11pm and 6am</li>
</ul>

May he loses his chins ASAP.

The diet plan QSD intiated during <span class="barlow">Hilary Term 2022</span>:

his lack of attractiveness and <i>eo ipso</i> girlfriend.</p>

The dawn of this new era brings about the following commitments:

<h6>Commitments</h6>
<ul>
<li>A strict prohibition on any intake of non-formal dessert</li>
<li>A strict prohibition on any intake of fruit tea and milk tea</li>
<li>A strict prohibition on any intake of ice-cream</li>
<li>A strict prohibition on any intake of chocolate/candies/biscuits/cakes, with an exemption of a pack of Oreo every fortnight</li>
<li>A strict prohibition on any intake of chips and crisps</li>
<li>A strict prohibition on KFC</li>
<li>A strict prohibition on any non-liquid intake between 10pm and 6am</li>
<li>A restriction on Kebab to salad</li>
<li>A restriction on coffee to Americano, with an exemption of a cup of latte every week</li>
<li>A restriction on soft drink to diet coke</li>
<li>A restriction on McDonald’s to £5 per purchase</li>
<li>A restriction on Burger King to one burger per purchase</li>
<li>A restriction of amount on Tesco’s Mango Pack to three per day</li>

## Attempt #3: From 22.01.2021 To 21.03.2021
{: .didot}

<span class="barlow">The genesis of this noble battle against obesity traced to that fateful day - <b>January 22, 2021</b>. A certain indiviudual took a most horrendous portrait of QSD, who upon reviewing it, was thoroughly <b>aghast</b> at the fleshiness of his cheek.</span>

> 减肥宗旨如下：
> - Avoid all snacks, deserts, beverages, chips, and other junk food.
>
> Alas, at this early age of his, QSD has not developed a taste for formal propositions and documentation.


A record of QSD's daily diet during the period was kept:
