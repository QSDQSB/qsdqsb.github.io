# #DAY01

As they say, where of what is past is prologue.


There are moments we do not want to forget, and moments we entreat ourselves to forget. 

But the past hast not just passed. It changes us. It defines us. It lives with us permanently, like an indelible mark. 

There was joy, there was hope, there was sorrow, there was despair. 

Scars are carved on our body, engraved in our heart, leaving every soul broken. Heart was kindered, and then banished, like a sick joke.

I only wish to catch a glimpse of my own life, joyful or not, before the memory fades away, along with the past.
