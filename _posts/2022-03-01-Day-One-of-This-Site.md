# DAY ONE OF THIS SITE
{: .barlow}

As they say, whereof what is past is prologue.

There are moments we do not want to forget, and moments we entreat ourselves to forget. 

But the past has not just passed. It changes us. It defines us. It lives with us permanently, like an indelible mark. 

There was joy, there was hope, there was sorrow, there was despair. 

Scars are carved on our bodies, engraved in our souls. Hearts were kindled and banished once and once again, like Sisyphus' punishment.

We have buried the past, but still need to let go. How do we truly get away with it? We inscribe an epitaph. An epilogue, a farewell to an old friend. And that is the point of this site.

I only wish to catch a glimpse of my own life, joyful or not, before it slips beneath the tide of time.
